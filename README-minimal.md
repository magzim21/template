# Purpose  
This is a python script that puts custom metric to the CloudWatch.  
The metric name is **BacklogPerInstance** .
The logic of this script derives from this [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html#create-sqs-cw-alarms-cli)

## Branching strategy
**Not specified** 
Here are suggested flows:

GitHub flow - main ➕ feature branches. Easy to start. Good for small teams. Remember to merge often!
GitLab flow - main ➕ development or environment branches. Good for GitOps.
CI / Trunk Based Development - only main branch. Good when you are just starting up, need to iterate quickly or you work mostly with senior developers. Do not use with open source.]
SimGit flow - a simplified version of Legacy GitFlow. Good for BIG teams.

## Releases
